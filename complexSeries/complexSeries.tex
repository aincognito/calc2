\begin{definition} 
A complex series  is defined as a limit of its sequence partial sums:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k = \lim_{n \to \infty}  \sum_{k=1}^n c_k = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n
\]
If the sequence $\{S_n\}$ converges, then we say the series converges.  Otherwise, we say that the series diverges. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Test for Divergence]
If $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$ converges, then $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} c_n = 0$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Note that $c_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$, the difference in partial sums. Since the sequence $\{S_n\}$ converges, given $\epsilon >0$,
there exists a number $N$ and a number $S$ such that if $n>N$ then $|S_n - S| < \epsilon/2$. Hence for $n > N+1$, the triangle inequality gives
\begin{align*}
|c_n| &= |S_n - S_{n-1}| = |(S_n -S) + (S-S_{n-1})| \\
&\leq |S_n -S| + |S-S_{n-1}| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} =\epsilon
\end{align*}
Hence, the sequence $\{c_n\}$ converges to zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Geometric Series]
Let $c \in \C$ and consider the series
\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty c^k = 1 + c + c^2 + c^3 + \cdots
\]
This series converges if and only if $|c| < 1$.  Moreover, if it converges, its sum is 
$\displaystyle \frac{1}{1-c}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $|c| < 1$. Then the partial sum has a closed form whose limit can be computed directly.
Since
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n c^k = 1+c+c^2+\cdots + c^n
\]
we have
\[
cS_n = c+c^2+\cdots + c^{n+1}
\]
Subtracting gives
\[
S_n - cS_n = 1-c^{n+1}
\]
from which we obtain the closed form
\[
S_n = \frac{1-c^{n+1}}{1-c}
\]
Now, since $|c|<1$, we have $c^n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ and hence
\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty c^k = \lim_{n\to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1-c^{n+1}}{1-c} = \frac{1}{1-c}
\]
Thus, the geometric series converges and its sum is also known.\\
If $|c| \geq 1$ then $c^n \nrightarrow 0$ as $n \to \infty$ which implies 
that the geometric series diverges (by the Test for Divergence).
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Absolute Convergence]
If the series $\dis \sum_{k=1}^\infty |c_k|$ converges, then so does the complex series $\dis \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{remark}
To prove this result, we will need the Monotone Convergence Theorem which states that a bounded, monotone sequence of real numbers converges.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty |c_k|$ converges to the real nmumber $S$, and break the partial sums of  the complex series 
$\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$ into their real and imaginary parts:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n c_k =  \sum_{k=1}^n a_k + i\sum_{k=1}^n b_k
\]
where $a_k, b_k \in \R$ for all $k$.  Let $a_k^+ = a_k$ if $a_k \geq 0$ and let $a_k^+ = 0$ if $a_k < 0$.
Similarly, let $a_k^- = -a_k$ if $a_k < 0$ and let $a_k^- = 0$ if $a_k \geq 0$. Then 
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^+ - \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^- = A_n^+ - A_n^-
\]
The sequences $\{A_n^+\}$ and $\{A_n^-\}$ are both increasing sequences and since $|a_n| \leq |c_n|$ for all $n$, they are both bounded above by $S$.
Hence, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, both sequences converge.
Thus, the real series $\dis \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ converges, to a sum, $A$. Applying the same argument to the partial sums of the imaginary part, 
$\dis \sum_{k=1}^n b_k$, we see that it too converges to a sum, $B$. Finally, we can conclude that $\dis \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$ converges to $A + iB$. 
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
We define the limit superior, or $\limsup$, of a sequence of real numbers $\{a_n\}$ to be the largest limit of any subsequence of $\{a_n\}$.\
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}
If the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to $a$, then $\limsup a_n =a$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
It is possible that $\limsup a_n =\pm\infty$
\end{remark}


\begin{theorem}[Root Test]
Let $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$ be a complex series and let 
\[
L = \limsup \sqrt[k]{|c_k|}
\]
Then the series converges if and only if $L <1$.
\end{theorem}
