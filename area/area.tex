\section{Area Between Curves}

In this section use definite integrals to find the area of a region 
in the $xy$-plane bounded by two or more curves. Reacll that if $f(x)$ is a positive, continuous function 
over the interval $[a, b]$ then the area bounded below the curve, above the $x$-axis and between the lines $x = a$
and $x = b$ is given by the definite integral, $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$. If we modify this slightly, 
we can find the area of a region between two continuous functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. First, suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$
are positive, continuous functions on the interval $[a,b]$ with $f(x) \geq g(x)$.
Then the area between the curves is the difference between the area under $f(x)$ and the area under $g(x)$.

Hence
\[
\text{Area} = \int_a^b f(x) \; dx - \int_a^b g(x) \; dx.
\]
We can simplify this formula slightly by combining these two integrals into a single integral, as in the theorem below. 


\begin{theorem}
Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continuous on the interval $[a,b]$. If $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x$ in the interval $[a,b]$, 
then the area of the region bounded by the graphs of $y = f(x), y=g(x), x=a,$ and $x=b$ is given by  
\[
\text{Area} = \int_a^b \left[f(x) -g(x)\right] \; dx.
\]
\end{theorem}


\begin{remark}
There is no need to assume that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are positive in the theorem.  It suffices that $f(x) \geq g(x)$ on $[a,b]$ since the area of the region between 
$f(x) + k$ and $g(x) + k$ is the same for any constant $k$ and if $k$ is large enough then both $f(x) + k$ and $g(x) + k$ are positive
on the closed interval $[a,b]$.
\end{remark}




\begin{example} %example #1
Find the area of the region bounded by curves $y = 5 - x^2$ and $y = x-4$ over the interval $[1,2]$.
Since $5 - x^2 > x-4$ over the interval $[1,2]$, the area is
\begin{align*}
\int_1^2 \left[(5-x^2) - (x-4)\right] \; dx &= \int_1^2 \left(9-x-x^2\right) \; dx \\
                                           &= \left(9x - \frac12 x^2 - \frac13 x^3 \right) \bigg|_1^2 \\
                                           &= \left(18 - 2 - \frac83 \right) - \left(9 - \frac12 - \frac13 \right)\\
                                           &= 7 - \frac73 + \frac12 \\
                                           & = \frac{31}{6}.
\end{align*}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
Find the area of the region bounded by the curves $y = \cos(x)$ and $y = \sin(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$.
Since $\cos(x) \geq \sin(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{4}\right]$ (see the figure below), the area of the region is given by
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\pi/4} [\cos(x) - \sin(x)] \; dx &= [\sin(x) + \cos(x)]\Big|_0^{\pi/4} \\
                                         &= [\sin(\pi/4) + \cos(\pi/4)] - [\sin(0) + \cos(0)]\\
                                          &= \left(\tfrac{\sqrt 2}{2} + \tfrac{\sqrt 2}{2} \right) - (0 + 1) \\
                                         &= \sqrt 2 - 1.
\end{align*}

In some cases, the left and right boundaries of the region are determined by points of intersection between the curves in question.

\begin{example}
Find the area between the parabola $y = x^2 + x - 3$ and the line $y = 2x - 1$. The left and right boundaries of the region between the line and the parabola are 
the points of intersection of the two curves. To find these points of intersection, we set them equal and solve for $x$:
\[
x^2 + x - 3 = 2x-1.
\]
Moving the terms to the left gives
\[
 x^2 -x -2 = 0.
 \]
 Then factor:
 \[
  (x+1)(x-2) = 0,
  \]
  which gives
  \[
   x = -1 \;\text{and}\; x= 2
   \]
   as the solutions.
Noting that the line is above the parabola (see the figure below), the area between the curves is 

\begin{align*}
\int_1^2 \left[(2x - 1) - (x^2 + x - 3)\right] \; dx &= \int_{-1}^2 \left(2 + x - x^2\right) \; dx \\
                                           &= \left(2x + \frac12 x^2 - \frac13 x^3 \right) \bigg|_{-1}^2 \\
                                           &= \left(4 + 2 - \frac83 \right) - \left(2 + \frac12 - \frac13 \right)\\
                                           &= 4 - \frac73 + \frac12 \\
                                           & = \frac{13}{6}.
\end{align*}

\begin{example}
Find the area of the region bounded by the curves $y = \sqrt x$ and $y = x^2$.
We find the points of intersection of the curves by solving the equation $\sqrt x = x^2$.
We can square both sides, move the terms to one side, and factor, but the elementary nature of this equation allows up 
to find the two solutions by inspection.  The curves intersect at $x = 0$ and at $x = 1$.
Noting that $\sqrt x \geq x^2$ on the interval $[0,1]$, we can calculate the area of the region as
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \left(\sqrt x - x^2 \right) \; dx &= \int_0^1 \left(x^{1/2} - x^2 \right) \; dx  \\
                                          &=  \left(\frac23 x^{3/2} - \frac13 x^3 \right) \bigg|_0^1 \\
                                          &=  \left( \tfrac23 - \tfrac13 \right) - (0-0) \\
                                          &= \frac13.
\end{align*}

\begin{example} %example #15
Find $h'(x)$ if $h(x) = x^{\sin(x)}$.\\
We will use the fact that the exponential and logarithm functions are inverses,
\[e^{\ln(x)} = x,\]
and the exponent property of logarithms, 
\[\ln(x^n) = n\ln(x),\]
to rewrite $h(x)$.  We have 
\[h(x) = x^{\sin(x)} = e^{\ln(x^{\sin(x)})} = e^{\sin(x)\ln(x)}\]
and we can now compute $h'(x)$ using a combination of the chain rule and product rule.
We can write $h(x)$ as a composition, $f(g(x))$ with 
\[g(x) = \sin(x)\ln(x) \quad \text{and} \quad f(x) = e^x.\]
Then to find $g'(x)$ we us the product rule and we get $g'(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} + \cos(x)\ln(x)$.
Next $f'(x) = e^x$ and 
hence $f'(g(x)) = e^{g(x)} = e^{\sin(x)\ln(x)} = x^{\sin(x)}$.
We can then conclude $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = x^{\sin(x)} \left[ \frac{\sin(x)}{x} + \cos(x)\ln(x)\right]$.
