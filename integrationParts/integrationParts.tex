We will use the integration by parts (IBP) formula to compute integrals involving products of unrelated factors.

\begin{theorem}[Integration by Parts]
\[
\int u \; dv = uv - \int v \; du
\]
\end{theorem}






\begin{example} %example #1
Compute the integral using IBP:
  \[
  \int x\sin(x) \;dx.
  \]
  
  The integrand is the product of two factors, $x$ and $\sin(x)$.  We consider one factor to differentiate and the other factor to anti-differentiate.
  The factor we prefer to differentiate is $x$ since the derivative of $x$ is a constant and constants are easy to deal with in integrals.
  As for the $\sin(x)$ factor, whether we differentiate it or anti-differentiate it makes little difference.  In fact, only a change in sign occurs,
  as 
  \[\frac{d}{dx}{\sin(x)} = \cos(x)    \text{ \;\;   and \;\;   }   \int \sin(x) \;dx = -\cos(x) + C.\]
  Thus to apply the IBP formula, we let
  \[u=x \text{  and  }  dv = \sin(x) \;dx.\]
  Next, we compute
  \[du = dx  \text{  \;\;  and \;\;   }  v = -\cos(x).\]
  \begin{remark} 
  We do not need to add the constant of integration to v, as any anti-derivative will suffice 
  for our purpose and we choose the constant of integration to be zero.
  \end{remark}
  Now we use the Integration by Parts formula, $\int u\;dv = uv-\int v\; du$:
  \[
  \int x\sin(x) = -x\cos(x) - \int -\cos(x) \;dx = -x\cos(x) + \int \cos(x) \;dx
  \]
  \[
  = -x\cos(x) + \sin(x) + C.
  \]
  We have found an answer, but at this stage we should prove that it is the correct answer by differentiating it.  The result should be $x\sin(x)$.
  Note that the differentiation requires the product rule on the $uv$ term: $-x\cos(x)$.
  We have
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}{\left(-x\cos(x) + \sin(x) + C\right)} = [-\cos(x) + x\sin(x)] + \cos(x) = x\sin(x)
  \]
  which proves that our answer was correct.

\begin{problem} %problem #1
  Compute the integral using IBP:
  \[
  \int xe^x \;dx.
  \]
  
  Let $u = \answer{x}$   and   $dv = \answer{e^x dx}$.\\
  Then $du = \answer{dx}$   and   $v = \answer{e^x}$.\\
  Thus 
  \[
  \int xe^x dx = xe^x - \int \answer{e^x} dx = \answer{xe^x - e^x} + C.
  \]

  Let $u = \answer{x}$   and   $dv = \answer{\cos(x) \;dx}$.\\

\begin{example} %example #15
Find $h'(x)$ if $h(x) = x^{\sin(x)}$.\\
We will use the fact that the exponential and logarithm functions are inverses,
\[e^{\ln(x)} = x,\]
and the exponent property of logarithms, 
\[\ln(x^n) = n\ln(x),\]
to rewrite $h(x)$.  We have 
\[h(x) = x^{\sin(x)} = e^{\ln(x^{\sin(x)})} = e^{\sin(x)\ln(x)}\]
and we can now compute $h'(x)$ using a combination of the chain rule and product rule.
We can write $h(x)$ as a composition, $f(g(x))$ with 
\[g(x) = \sin(x)\ln(x) \quad \text{and} \quad f(x) = e^x.\]
Then to find $g'(x)$ we us the product rule and we get $g'(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} + \cos(x)\ln(x)$.
Next $f'(x) = e^x$ and 
hence $f'(g(x)) = e^{g(x)} = e^{\sin(x)\ln(x)} = x^{\sin(x)}$.
We can then conclude $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = x^{\sin(x)} \left[ \frac{\sin(x)}{x} + \cos(x)\ln(x)\right]$.
