\section{Applications of Definite Integrals}


\subsection{Average Value}
\begin{definition}[Average Value]
If $f(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$, then the average value 
of $f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ is given by
\[f_{ave} = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) \ dx.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Compute the average value of $f(x) = x^2$ on the interval $[0,2]$.\\
The average value is given by 
\begin{align*}
f_{ave} &= \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) \ dx \\
 & = \frac12\int_0^2 x^2 \ dx \\
 & = \frac{x^3}{6} \Bigg|_0^2 \\
  & = \tfrac43
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{problem}
Compute the average value of $f(x) = x(x+1) +1$ on the interval $[0,3]$.
\begin{hint}
Multiply first, then integrate
\end{hint}
\[f_{ave} = \answer{11/2}.\]
\end{problem} 

\begin{example}
Compute the average value of $f(x) = \sin(x)$ on the interval $[0,\pi]$.\\
The average value is given by 
\begin{align*}
f_{ave} &= \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) \ dx \\
 & = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\pi \sin(x) \ dx \\
 & = -\frac{1}{\pi} \cos(x) \Bigg|_0^\pi \\
  & = \frac{2}{\pi}
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{problem}
Compute the average value of $f(x) = \cos(2x) + \sin(2x)$ on the interval $[0,\pi/2]$.
\begin{hint}
An anti-derivative of $\cos(2x) + \sin(2x)$ is  $\tfrac12\sin(2x) - \tfrac12\cos(2x)$
\end{hint}
\[f_{ave} = \answer{2/\pi}.\]
\end{problem} 


\begin{example}
Compute the average value of $f(x) = e^{2x}$ on the interval $[-1,1]$.\\
The average value is given by 
\begin{align*}
f_{ave} &= \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) \ dx \\
 & = \frac12\int_{-1}^1 e^{2x} \ dx \\
 & = \frac14 e^{2x} \Bigg|_{-1}^1 \\
  & = \frac{e^2 - e^{-2}}{4}
\end{align*}
\end{example}


\begin{problem}
Compute the average value of $f(x) = e^{3x}$ on the interval $[-1,1]$.
\[f_{ave} = \answer{\frac{e^{3} - e^{-3}}{6}}.\]
\end{problem} 


\subsection{Rectilinear Motion}

Suppose that a projectile is launched vertically into the air.
Then, the height of the object at time $t$, the velocity at time $t$, and the acceleration at time $t$ are related as follows:
\[v(t) = s'(t)\]
and
\[a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t).\]

We can also use indefinite integrals to express these relationships:
\[s(t) = \int v(t) \ dt\]
and
\[v(t) = \int a(t) \ dt.\]

\begin{proposition}
Suppose that a vertical projectile has instantaneous velocity $v(t)$, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item the displacement over the interval $[a,b]$ is given by 
\[\int_a^b v(t) \ dt\]
and
\item the distance traveled over the interval $[a,b]$ is given by 
\[\int_a^b |v(t)| \ dt.\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}
An object is launched vertically from a height of $16 ft$ with an initial velocity of $48 ft/sec$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a formula, $s(t)$, for the height of the object at time $t$
 seconds.
\item Find the displacement of the object from time $t = 0$ to time $t = 2$.
\item Find the total distance traveled from time $t = 0$ to time $t = 2$.
\end{enumerate}

Assuming that $a(t) = -32 ft/sec^2$, as it is on the surface of the earth, 
we can compute $v(t)$ by using an indefinite integral:
\[v(t) = \int a(t) \ dt = \int -32 \ dt = -32t + C.\]
To find the value of the constant $C$, we use the fact that the initial velocity was given as $48 ft/sec$:
\[v(0) = -32(0) + C = 48,\]
which implies that $C = 48$.  Thus
\[v(t) = -32t + 48.\]
Next, we repeat the process to find $s(t)$:
\[s(t) = \int v(t) \ dt = \int (-32t + 48) \ dt = -16t^2 + 48t + C.\]
To find $C$, we use the given information about the initial height of the object:
\[s(0) = -16t^2 + 48(0) + C = 16,\]
which implies $C = 16$.  Thus,
\[s(t) = -16t^2 + 48t + 16.\]
Next, to find the displacement from $t= 0$ to $t = 2$, we compute
\[s(2) - s(0) = (-64+96+16)-(16) = 32 \text{feet}.\]
Note that we could have computed $s(2) - s(0)$ as a definite integral:
\[\int_0^2 v(t) \ dt = s(2) - s(0),\]
since $s(t)$ is an anti-derivative of $v(t)$.
Finally, to find the total distance traveled from $t = 0$ to time $t = 2$,
we need integrate $|v(t)|$. To get a handle on $|v(t)|$, recall
\[|x| = \left\{
     \begin{array}{rc}
       x & \ \text{if} \  x \geq 0 \\
			 -x & \ \text{if} \ x <0
     \end{array}
   \right.
\]
Noting that $v(1.5) = -32(1.5) + 48 = 0$, we can see that
\[|v(t)| = |-32t + 48| = \left\{\begin{array}{rc}
       -32t + 48  &\ \text{if} \  t \leq 1.5 \\
			 32t - 48  &\ \text{if} \ t > 1.5
     \end{array}
   \right.
\]


Hence, the total distance traveled from $t=0$ to $t = 2$ is
\[\int_0^2 |v(t)| \ dt = \int_0^{1.5} (-32t + 48) \ dt + \int_{1.5}^2 (32t -48) \ dt = 36 + 4 = 40 \ \text{feet}.\]


\end{example}

\begin{problem}
An object is launched vertically from a height of $24 ft$ with an initial velocity of $64 ft/sec$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a formula, $s(t)$, for the height of the object at time $t$
 seconds.
\item Find the maximum height reached by the object.
\item Find the displacement of the object from time $t = 0$ to time $t = 3$.
\item Find the total distance traveled from time $t = 0$ to time $t = 3$.
\end{enumerate}
