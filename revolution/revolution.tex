We now find the volume of a solid of revolution.  

\begin{definition}[Solid of revolution] A \textbf{solid of revolution} is obtained by revolving a region in the plane about 
a line.  The line is referred to as the \textbf{axis of revolution}.

\end{definition}

As we will soon see, some familiar solids like cylinders, cones and spheres are solids of revolution.
The main formula we will need from geometry is the area of a circle of radius $r$: $A = \pi r^2$. 

\section{Disks}

Consider a vertical line segment 2 units long that touches the $x$-axis at one end.  

(SEE FIGURE)


If we revolve this segment about the axis, it will make a circle of radius 2 whose area is $4\pi$.
As in the previous section, we will associate a thickness, $dx$, to the infinitely narrow segment.
Then after revolving the segment, we get a \textbf{disk} whose volume is 
\[
V = \pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot dx = 4\pi dx.
\]

We now consider an example where we apply this idea to find the volume of a solid of revolution.

\begin{example}[Volume of a Cone]
In this example, we find the volume of a cone with height $h$ and base radius $r$.
To create the cone, consider the line $y = \frac{r}{h} x$ which goes through the origin and the point $(h,r)$.
Our cone is obtained by revolving the region between this line and the $x$-axis over the interval $[0,h]$

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

We imagine our cone as being constructed by revolving each of the vertical segments in our region individually.
For any value of $x$ between $x = 0$ and $x = h$, the length of the segment is given by the corresponding $y$-coordinate
on the line, $y = \frac{r}{h} x$. Assuming that this segment has thickness $dx$, the volume of the resulting disk is 
\[
v_x = \pi r^2 dx = \pi y^2 \; dx = \pi \left(\frac{r}{h} s\right)^2 \; dx = \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} x^2 \; dx.
\]

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of the solid of revolution, i.e., our cone, is then obtained by adding the volumes of these infinitely thin disks using a definite integral:
\[
V = \int_0^h V_x \; dx = \int_0^h \pi r^2 \; dx = \int_0^h \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} x^2 \; dx 
\]
\[
= \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2}\int_0^h  x^2 \; dx = \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} \left(\frac{x^3}{3}\right)\bigg|_0^h 
\]
\[
= \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} \left(\frac{h^3}{3} - 0\right) = \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} \cdot \frac{h^3}{3} = \frac13 \pi r^2 h.
\]

Thus, the volume of a ccone of height $h$ and base radius $r$ is $V = \frac13 \pi r^2 h$, i.e., its volume is 1/3 of 
volume of the cylinder with the same height and radius.

\begin{example}[Volume of a Sphere]
In this example, we find the volume of a sphere with radius $r$.
To create the sphere, consider the semi-circle or radius $r$ centered at the origin: $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$.
Our sphere is obtained by revolving the region between this semi-circle and the $x$-axis over the interval $[-r,r]$

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

We imagine the sphere as being constructed by revolving each of the vertical segments in our region individually.
For any value of $x$ between $x = -r$ and $x = r$, the length of the segment is given by the corresponding $y$-coordinate
on the semi-circle, $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$. Assuming that this segment has thickness $dx$, the volume of the resulting disk is 
\[
v_x = \pi r^2 dx = \pi y^2 \; dx = \pi \left(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right)^2 dx = \pi (r^2 - x^2)\; dx.
\]

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of the solid of revolution, i.e., our sphere, is then obtained by adding the volumes of these infinitely thin disks using a definite integral:
\[
V = \int_{-r}^r V_x \; dx = \int_{-r}^r \pi r^2 \; dx = \int_{-r}^r \pi (r^2 - x^2) \; dx 
\]
\[
= \pi \int_{-r}^r  (r^2 - x^2) \; dx = \pi  \left(r^2 x - \frac{x^3}{3}\right)\bigg|_{-r}^r 
\]
\[
= \pi \left[ \left(r^3 - \frac{r^3}{3}\right) - \left(-r^3 + \frac{r^3}{3}\right)\right] = \pi \left(\frac{2r^3}{3} + \frac{2r^3}{3}\right) = \frac43 \pi r^3.
\]

Thus, the volume of a sphere of radius $r$ is $V = \frac43 \pi r^3$.
