We now find the volume of a solid of revolution.  

\begin{definition}[Solid of revolution] A \textbf{solid of revolution} is obtained by revolving a region in the plane about 
a line.  The line is referred to as the \textbf{axis of revolution}.

\end{definition}

As we will soon see, some familiar solids like cylinders, cones and spheres are solids of revolution.
The main formula we will need from geometry is the area of a circle of radius $r$: $A = \pi r^2$. 

\section{Disks}

Consider a vertical line segment 2 units long that touches the $x$-axis at one end.  

(SEE FIGURE)


If we revolve this segment about the axis, it will make a circle of radius 2 whose area is $4\pi$.
As in the previous section, we will associate a thickness, $dx$, to the infinitely narrow segment.
Then after revolving the segment, we get a \textbf{disk} whose volume is 
\[
V = \pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot dx = 4\pi dx.
\]

We now consider an example where we apply this idea to find the volume of a solid of revolution.

\begin{example}[Volume of a Cone]
In this example, we find the volume of a cone with height $h$ and base radius $r$.
To create the cone, consider the line $y = \frac{r}{h} x$ which goes through the origin and the point $(h,r)$.
Our cone is obtained by revolving the region between this line and the $x$-axis over the interval $[0,h]$

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

We imagine our cone as being constructed by revolving each of the vertical segments in our region individually.
For any value of $x$ between $x = 0$ and $x = h$, the length of the segment is given by the corresponding $y$-coordinate
on the line, $y = \frac{r}{h} x$. Assuming that this segment has thickness $dx$, the volume of the resulting disk is 
\[
v_x = \pi r^2 dx = \pi y^2 \; dx = \pi \left(\frac{r}{h} s\right)^2 \; dx = \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} x^2 \; dx.
\]

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of the solid of revolution, i.e., our cone, is then obtained by adding the volumes of these infinitely thin disks using a definite integral:
\[
V = \int_0^h V_x \; dx = \int_0^h \pi r^2 \; dx = \int_0^h \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} x^2 \; dx 
\]
\[
= \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2}\int_0^h  x^2 \; dx = \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} \left(\frac{x^3}{3}\right)\bigg|_0^h 
\]
\[
= \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} \left(\frac{h^3}{3} - 0\right) = \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} \cdot \frac{h^3}{3} = \frac13 \pi r^2 h.
\]

Thus, the volume of a ccone of height $h$ and base radius $r$ is $V = \frac13 \pi r^2 h$, i.e., its volume is 1/3 of 
volume of the cylinder with the same height and radius.

\end{example}





\begin{example}[Volume of a Sphere]
In this example, we find the volume of a sphere with radius $r$.
To create the sphere, consider the semi-circle or radius $r$ centered at the origin: $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$.
Our sphere is obtained by revolving the region between this semi-circle and the $x$-axis over the interval $[-r,r]$

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

We imagine the sphere as being constructed by revolving each of the vertical segments in our region individually.
For any value of $x$ between $x = -r$ and $x = r$, the length of the segment is given by the corresponding $y$-coordinate
on the semi-circle, $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$. Assuming that this segment has thickness $dx$, the volume of the resulting disk is 
\[
v_x = \pi r^2 dx = \pi y^2 \; dx = \pi \left(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right)^2 dx = \pi (r^2 - x^2)\; dx.
\]

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of the solid of revolution, i.e., our sphere, is then obtained by adding the volumes of these infinitely thin disks using a definite integral:
\[
V = \int_{-r}^r V_x \; dx = \int_{-r}^r \pi r^2 \; dx = \int_{-r}^r \pi (r^2 - x^2) \; dx 
\]
\[
= \pi \int_{-r}^r  (r^2 - x^2) \; dx = \pi  \left(r^2 x - \frac{x^3}{3}\right)\bigg|_{-r}^r 
\]
\[
= \pi \left[ \left(r^3 - \frac{r^3}{3}\right) - \left(-r^3 + \frac{r^3}{3}\right)\right] = \pi \left(\frac{2r^3}{3} + \frac{2r^3}{3}\right) = \frac43 \pi r^3.
\]

Thus, the volume of a sphere of radius $r$ is $V = \frac43 \pi r^3$.

\begin{example} Find the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of $y=x^2, y=0, x=0$, and $x = 1$
about the $x$-axis.\\
We begin with a sketch of the region.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

To compute the volume of the resulting solid, fix a value of $x$ between 0 and 1 and consider a vertical segment in the region at this $x$-value.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

Revolving this individual segment about the $x$-axis yields a disk with radius $r = x^2$ and thickness $dx$. 

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of this disk is then
\[
V_x = \pi r^2 h = \pi (x^2)^2 \; dx = \pi x^4 \; dx.
\]
The volume of the solid can be otained by integrating $V_x$ as $x$ ranges from 0 to 1:
\[
V = \int_0^1 V_x \; dx = \int_0^1 \pi x^4 \; dx = \pi \frac{x^5}{5}\bigg|_0^1 = \frac{\pi}{5}.

\section{Washers} In the next series of examples, the region will not border the axis of revolution. 
In this situation, the resulting cross-sections are washers rather than disks.
The area of a washer with inner radius, $r$, and outer radius, $R$, is given by 
\[
A = \pi(R^2 - r^2).
\]

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

If we attribute an infinitesimal thickness, $dx$, to the washer, then its volume is
\[
V = \pi(R^2 - r^2) h = \pi(R^2 - r^2) \; dx.
\]
We now use this to calculuate volumes of solids of revolutions about the $x$-axis in which the region does not border the axis.

\begin{example} Find the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of 
$y = e^x, y = 3, x = 0$, and $x = 1$ about the $x$-axis.\\
We begin with a sketch of the region.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

To compute the volume of the resulting solid, fix a value of $x$ between 0 and 1 and consider a vertical segment in the region at this $x$-value.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

Revolving this individual segment about the $x$-axis yields a washer with inner radius, $r = e^x$, outer radius, $R = 3$, and thickness, $dx$. 

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of this washer is then
\[
V_x = \pi (R^2 - r^2) h = \pi \left[3^2 - \left(e^x\right)^2\right] \; dx = \pi \left(9 - e^{2x}\right) \; dx.
\]
The volume of the solid can be otained by integrating $V_x$ as $x$ ranges from 0 to 1:
\[
V = \int_0^1 V_x \; dx = \int_0^1 \pi \left(9 - e^{2x}\right) \; dx = \pi \left(9x - \frac{e^{2x}}{2}\right)\bigg|_0^1 = \left(10-\frac{e^2}{2}\right)\pi.
\]

\begin{example} Find the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of 
$y = \sec(x), y = 2, x = 0$, and $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ about the $x$-axis.\\
We begin with a sketch of the region.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

To compute the volume of the resulting solid, fix a value of $x$ between 0 and $\frac{\pi}{4}$ and consider a vertical segment in the region at this $x$-value.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

Revolving this individual segment about the $x$-axis yields a washer with inner radius, $r = \sec(x)$, outer radius, $R = 2$, and thickness, $dx$. 

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of this washer is then
\[
V_x = \pi (R^2 - r^2) h = \pi \left[2^2 - \sec^2(x)\right] \; dx = \pi \left[4 - \sec^2(x)\right] \; dx.
\]
The volume of the solid can be otained by integrating $V_x$ as $x$ ranges from 0 to $\pi/4$:
\[
V = \int_0^{\pi/4} V_x \; dx = \int_0^{\pi/4} \pi \left[4-\sec^2(x)\right] \; dx = \pi \left[4x - \tan(x)\right]\bigg|_0^{\pi/4} = \pi^2 - \pi.

\section{Cylindrical shells}


We now find the volume of solids of revolution obtained by revolving a region about a vertical axis.

\begin{example} Find the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of $y = x^2, y=0, x=0$, and $x = 1$ about the $y$-axis.\\
We begin with a sketch of the region.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

To compute the volume of the resulting solid, fix a value of $x$ between 0 and 1 and consider a vertical segment in the region at this $x$-value.

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

Revolving this individual segment about the $y$-axis yields a cylindrical shell with radius, $r = x,$ height, $h = x^2$, and thickness, $dx$. 

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of this shell is the surface area of the shell multiplied by its thickness:
\[
V_x = 2\pi rh \;dx = 2\pi x(x^2) \; dx = 2\pi x^3 \; dx.
\]
The volume of the solid can be otained by integrating $V_x$ as $x$ ranges from 0 to 1:
\[
V = \int_0^1 V_x \; dx = \int_0^1 2\pi x^3 \; dx = 2\pi \frac{x^4}{4}\bigg|_0^1 = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

(INSERT FIGURE HERE)

The volume of this shell is the surface area of the shell multiplied by its thickness:
\[
V_x = 2\pi rh \;dx = 2\pi x(2 - \sqrt x) \; dx = 2\pi \left(2x - x^{3/2}\right) \; dx.
\]
The volume of the solid can be otained by integrating $V_x$ as $x$ ranges from 0 to 1:
\[
V = \int_0^1 V_x \; dx = \int_0^1 2\pi \left(2x - x^{3/2}\right) \; dx = 2\pi \left(x^2 - \frac25 x^{5/2}\right)\bigg|_0^1 = \frac{6\pi}{5}.
