\section{Limit Laws}
 
 In section 1.2, Numerical Limits, we briefly discussed "plugging in" to compute limits.
 The example we investigated was
 \[
 \lim_{x \to 3+} \left(x^2 + 2 \right) = 3^2 + 2 = 11.
 \]
 The reason pluggin in worked in the previous example was a direct consequence of the limit laws presented below.
 
In each of the following, all of the limits are assumed to exist.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[1.]  
The limit of a constant is the constant:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} k = k.
 \]
 
\item[2.]
 The next law is self-evident:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} x = c.
 \]
 
 \item[3.]
 The limit of a multiple of a function:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} kf(x) = k \cdot \lim_{x \to c} f(x). 
 \]
 
 \item[4.]
 The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} \left[f(x) + g(x) \right] = \lim_{x \to c} f(x) + \lim_{x \to c} g(x). 
 \]
 
\item[5.]
 The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} \left[f(x) - g(x) \right] = \lim_{x \to c} f(x) - \lim_{x \to c} g(x). 
 \]
 
\item[6.]
 The limit of a product is the product of the limits:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} f(x) g(x) = \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \cdot \lim_{x \to c} g(x). 
 \]


\item[7.]
 The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to c} g(x)}, 
 \]
 provided that the limit in the denominator is \textbf{not equal to zero}.
 
 \item[8.]
 Limits can be moved inside of radicals:
 \[
 \lim_{x \to c} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}. 
 \]

\end{enumerate}


Each of the above limit laws is valid if $x \to c^+, x\to c^-, x \to \infty$ or $x \to -\infty$.
