\section{Permutations}



\begin{definition}[Permutation]
A permutation of selection of objects in a particular order.
\end{definition}

Permutations are counted using the fundamental principle of counting.

\begin{example}[example 1]
A fifth grade class consisting of 24 students wishes to elect a class president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer.
Assuming that no student can hold more than one office, in how many ways can these
positions be filled?\\
The selection of class officers can be thought of as a permutation
the order of the selection of the 4 students determines which office they will hold. 
Thus, we seek the number of permutations of 24 objects taken 4 at a time, denoted $P(24, 4)$. By the FPC, we have
\[
P(24, 4) = 24 \times 23 \times 22 \times 21 = 255,024
\]
Thus, there are just over a quarter of a million possible outcomes for the selection of the class officers.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 1)
A sports team consisting of 12 players wishes to select a captain, 
an inspirational leader and an equipment manager (from amongst themselves).  
In how many ways can this be done?\\
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{P(12, 3)}
\choice{P(15, 3)}
\choice{P(9, 6)}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{problem}

\begin{proposition}
The number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $k$ at a time is
\[
P(n,k) = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1)
\]

\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The number of choices for the first object selected is $n$. The number of choices for the second object selected is $n-1$. And so on, until the $k$ object, for which there are $n-k+1$ choices remaining. The result then follows directly from the FPC. 
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
Note that the list $n, n-1, n-1, ..., n-k+1$ consists of $k$ numbers, corresponding to the $k$ objects being selected.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[example 2]
Compute $P(7, 3)$.\\
Using the proposition with $n = 7$ and $k = 3$, so that, $n-k+1 = 7-3+1 = 5$, we have
\[
P(7,3) = 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 210
\]
\end{example}
\begin{problem}(problem 2)
Compute each of the following:
$P(5,2) = \; \answer{20}$\\
$P(8,3) = \; \answer{336}$\\
$P(10,5) = \; \answer{30240}$
\end{problem}

\section{Factorials}

\begin{definition}[Factorial]
Let $n$ be a natural number. Then n! (read n factorial) is defined as
\[
n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[example 3]
Compute the following factorials: $2!\,, 4!\,, 6!$ and $8!$\\
We have
\[
2! = 2\cdot 1 = 2,
\]
\[
4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2\cdot 1 = 24,
\]
\[
6! = 6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2\cdot 1 = 720
\]
and
\[
8! = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2\cdot 1 = 40320
\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 3)
Compute the following factorials: \\
$3! = \; \answer{6}$\\
$5! = \; \answer{120}$\\
$7! = \; \answer{5040}$\\
$9! = \; \answer{362880}$\\
\end{problem}

We now explore the connection between factorials and permutations.

\begin{example}[example 4]
In how many ways can 5 people line up at an ATM?\\
The answer is the number of permutations of 5 objects taken 5 at a time, i.e., 
\[
P(5,5) = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 5! = 120
\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 4)
In how many ways can 6 people line up at an ATM (answer using factorials)? $\; \answer{6!}$
\end{problem}

General permutations can be expressed as a ratio of factorials.

\begin{proposition}
Let $n$ and $k$ be natural numbers with $n > k$. Then 
\[
P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The ratio of factorials lends itself to lots of cancellation. We have
\[
\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{(n-k) \cdot (n - k-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot  2 \cdot 1}
= n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1) = P(n,k).
\]
Note that the entire denominator cancelled out.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[example 5]
Express the following as a ratio of factorials: $P(7, 3), P(10, 4)$ and $P(100, 25)$.\\
For $P(7,3)$ we have $n = 7, k = 3$ and $n-k = 7-3 = 4$, so
\[
P(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{4!}
\]
Similarly,
\[
P(10,4) = \frac{10!}{6!} \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; P(100, 25) = \frac{100!}{75!}
\]
In applications, numbers such as $75!$ and $100!$ are too unwieldy to write out, so we will prefer the factorial notation
as a final form.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 5)
Express the following as a ratio of factorials:\\
$P(8,5) = \; \answer{\frac{8!}{3!}}$\\
$P(12,6) = \; \answer{\frac{12!}{6!}}$\\
$P(50,10) = \; \answer{\frac{50!}{40!}}$
\end{problem}

In the proposition, it was assumed that $n>k$.  But, what if $n = k$, for we have already seen 
the expression $P(n,n)$ arise in applications. 
In fact, $P(n,n) = n!$. To extend the proposition to cover this case we make the following definition.

\begin{definition}[0!]
We define 
\[
0! \equiv 1
\]
\end{definition}

With the above definition, we can safely revise the proposition to state that for $n$ and $k$ natural numbers with $n \geq k$,
we have
\[
P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\]
for if $n = k$ then the denominator is $0! = 1$.
