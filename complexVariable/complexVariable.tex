\section{The Complex Variable, $z$}

We typically use the variable $x$ to represent a real number and we write $x \in \R$.
In the complex plane we use the variable $z$, and write $z \in \C$. We can relate the variable $z$ to the real variables $x$ and $y$
from the $xy$-plane using the equation:
\[
z = x+iy
\]

Thus, the variable $z$ can be thought of as a pair of real variables, $x$ and $y$, 
which satisfy
\[
x = \Rep{z} \quad \mbox{and} \quad y = \Imp{z}
\]

The complex conjugate of $z = x+iy$ is
\[
\overline{z} = x-iy
\]

The modulus of $z = x+iy$ is
\[
|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
This can be written in terms of the complex conjugate as
\[
|z|^2 = z\overline{z} \quad \mbox{or} \quad |z| = \sqrt{z\overline{z}}
\]
The polar form of $z = x+iy$:
\[
z = r \cis \theta
\]
where $r = |z|$ and $\theta$ is an {\it argument} of $z$. If $x \neq 0$ then $\theta$ satisfies
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}
\]
This equation has infinitely many solutions, including
\[ 
\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\]
Note that this solution may or may not be an argument of $z$, but since the tangent function is $\pi$-periodic,
either
\[
\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \quad \mbox{or} \quad \pi + \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]
is an argument of $z$ as long as $x \neq 0$.


\section{Properties of $z$}


We now rewrite many of the properties of complex numbers learned in earlier sectiomns using the variable z.


Complex addition and multiplication are commutative and associative: 
\[
z_1 + z_2 = z_2 + z_1 \quad \mbox{and} \quad z_1 \cdot z_2 = z_2 \cdot z_1 \quad \mbox{(commutativity)}
\]
and
\[
(z_1 + z_2) + z_3  = z_1 + (z_2 + z_3) \quad \mbox{and} \quad (z_1 \cdot z_2) \cdot z_3  = z_1 \cdot (z_2 \cdot z_3) \quad \mbox{(associativity)}
\]
where $z_1, z_2, z_3 \in \C$.

Furthermore, the conjugate of a sum is the sum of the conjugates:
\[
\overline{z_1 + z_2} = \overline{z_1} + \overline{z_2},
\]

and the conjugate of a product is the product of the conjugates:
\[
\overline{z_1 z_2} = \overline{z_1} \cdot \overline{z_2}
\]
