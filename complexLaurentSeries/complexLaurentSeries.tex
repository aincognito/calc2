\maketitle

Consider the function $\dis f(z) = e^\frac{1}{z}$. This function is analytic in the punctured plane $\C\backslash\{0\}$.
Using the Maclaurin series for $e^z$ we can create a series representation for $e^\frac{1}{z}$ as follows:
\[
e^\frac{1}{z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{z}\right)^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!z^k} = 1+ \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{2! z^2} + \cdots
\]
 The ratio test shows that this series converges for all $z$ except $0$. This type of series is called a Laurent series.
 

\begin{definition} 
A series of the form 
\[
\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k = \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_{-k}(z-z_0)^{-k} + \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k
\]
is called the Laurent series centered at $z_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A function $f$ is said to have an isolated singularity at $z_0$ if $f$ is analytic on a punctured disk $D(z_0, r)\backslash\{z_0\}$ for some $r>0$
but not analytic at $z_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $f$ has an isolated singularity at $z_0$. Then $f$ has a Laurent series representation centered at $z_0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[example 1]
Find the Laurent series representation for $f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^3}$ centered at the origin.\\
The function $f(z) = e^z/z^3$ is analytic in the punctured plane, so it has an isolated singularity at the origin.
We can find its Laurent series representation centered at the origin by using the Mauriac series of $e^z$.
We have
\[
\frac{e^z}{z^3} = \frac{1}{z^3} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^{k-3}}{k!} 
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{z^3} + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{2!z} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{z}{4!} + \frac{z^2}{5!} + \cdots
\]
This representation is valid for all $z$ in the punctured plane.

Isolated singularities of a function can be classified according to the largest negative power appearing in
its Laurent series.

\begin{definition}
A function $f(z)$ with an isolated singularity at $z_0$ is said to have a {\bf pole of order} $\boldsymbol{k}$ at $z_0$
if is Laurent series centered at $z_0$ has the form
\[
f(z) = \frac{c_{-k}}{(z-z_0)^k} +  \frac{c_{-k+1}}{(z-z_0)^{k-1}} + \cdots + c_0 + c_1(z-z_0) + c_2(z-z_0)^2 + \cdots
\]
where $c_{-k} \neq 0$.
A pole of order $1$ is called a {\bf simple pole}. A pole of order $\infty$ is called an {\bf essential singularity}.
If the Laurent series has no terms with negative powers of $z-z_0$, then the singularity is a discontinuity.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[example 2]
Classify the singularity at the origin for the function $\dis f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^3}$.\\
The Laurent series for $f$ is
\[
\frac{e^z}{z^3} = \frac{1}{z^3} + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{2!z} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{z}{4!} + \frac{z^2}{5!} + \cdots
\]
Since the largest power of $z$ appearing in the denominators is $3$, the function $\dis f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^3}$
has a pole of order $3$ at the origin.

The term $\dis \frac{c_{-1}}{z-z_0}$ in a Laurent series is of particular importance in the theory of integration.

\begin{definition}
The coefficient $c_{-1}$ in the Laurent series for a function $f$ centered at $z_0$ is called the {\bf Residue} of $f$ at $z_0$, and it is denoted by
\[
\text{Res}(f,z_0) = c_{-1}
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{example}[example 3]
Find Res$(f,0)$ for $f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^3}$.\\
The Laurent series is
\[
\frac{e^z}{z^3} = \frac{1}{z^3} + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{2!z} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{z}{4!} + \frac{z^2}{5!} + \cdots
\]
and the term of interest is $ \frac{1}{2!z}$. Thus the residue, being the coefficient of this term is
\[
\text{Res}(f,0) = \frac{1}{2!} = \frac12
\]
\end{example}

\begin{example}[example 2]
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = z\sin(\pi z)$.\\
First note that $f(z)$ is an entire function, so it has a Maclaurin series representation.
Using the Maclaurin series for $\sin z$ gives
\[
z\sin(\pi z) = z\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{(\pi z)^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{\pi^{2k+1} z^{2k+2}}{(2k+1)!}
\]
The ratio test shows that this series converges for all $z$.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 2a)
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = e^{-z^2}$ and find its radius of convergence.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(problem 2b)
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = z\cos(\pi z)$ and find its radius of convergence.
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 3]
Find the first few terms of the Maclaurin series for $\tan z$.\\
Since $\tan z = \frac{\sin z}{\cos z}$ and $\cos 0 \neq 0$, $\tan z$ is analytic at the origin 
and has a Maclaurin series expansion:
\[
\tan z = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k z^k = c_0 + c_1 z + c_2 z^2 + \cdots
\]
Using the Maclaurin series of $\sin z$ and $\cos z$ and writing $\sin z = \tan z \cdot \cos z$ we have
\[
z-\frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \cdots = \left(c_0 + c_1 z + c_2 z^2 + \cdots\right) \cdot \left(1-\frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \cdots \right)
\]
Multiplying on the RHS and comparing coefficients leads to a system of equations:
\begin{align*}
0 & = c_0 \\
1 & = c_1 \\
0 & = c_2 -\frac{c_0}{2!} \\
-\frac{1}{3!} & =  c_3- \frac{c_1}{2!} \\
0 & = c_4 - \frac{c_2}{2!} +  \frac{c_0}{4!} \\
 \frac{1}{5!} & = c_5- \frac{c_3}{2!} +  \frac{c_1}{4!}\\
 & \text{etc.}
\end{align*}
Solving this system yields $c_0 = c_2 = c_4 = 0$, etc., and  $c_1 = 1, c_3 = \frac13, c_5 = \frac{2}{15}$ etc.
Hence 
\[
\tan z = z + \frac13 z + \frac{2}{15}z^3 + \cdots
\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 3)
Find the first few terms of the Maclaurin series for $\sec z$.
\end{problem}
